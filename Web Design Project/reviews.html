	<h1>Here's What the Experts Say About the PS5</h1>

			</th>
			<td>With a launch line-up dominated by games that are also available on PS4, and on the back of a generation already punctuated with incrementally more powerful hardware revisions like the PS4 Pro, the PS5 doesn’t quite land as a knockout punch yet – <b>but it’s definitely got the power and speed to be a real contender</b>. 
			However, while the PS5’s well-considered UI and blisteringly-quick loading times for PS5 games make it a pleasure to use, it’s the DualSense controller that’s proven to be the surprise haymaker I never saw coming; it truly leaves other controllers feeling primitive in comparison.</td>

			<td>The PS5 is a superb console that offers a compelling next-gen gaming experience - and one that will likely only get better as more titles are added to the lineup. <b>The PS5 proves itself to be both powerful and well-designed</b>. A few small issues hold it back from being a five-star product at launch, but otherwise it's a welcome upgrade on the PS4 and an exciting portal to next-gen gameplay.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
                        
			<th><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/06/tech/ps5-playstation-5-review/index.html">
			<img id="cnn" src="images/cnn.png"></a></th>
			<td>If you already own a PS4 Pro, as opposed to an old 1080p PlayStation, then the PlayStation 5's benefits may be a little more elusive. Still, for $500, you get a sleek new user interface, and slightly better-looking games, but that's about it.
			Sony's challenge may be getting gamers to upgrade their systems while the PS4 supports many of the new games being released. As developers start making games just for PS5, the console could grow more appealing.
			But for people excited about buying-in right away, <b>the PlayStation 5 doesn't disappoint</b> with experiences in "Miles Morales" and "Astro's Playroom" that hint at the potential of other titles to come. The future for PlayStation is very promising.
			</td>

		<tr>
			<th><a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/ps5">
			<img id="toms" src="images/toms.png"</a></th>
			<td>The PS5 is a true generational leap, offering incredibly fast load times and an innovative new controller that can change the way games feel.
			Thanks to its robust backwards compatibility, snappy interface, gorgeous game performance and incredible load times, <b>the PS5 already feels like the future of console gaming</b>. And it's hard to go back.	</td>
